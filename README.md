### Description:

We added 3 main sections which are: header, main, footer.

Header includes a \<nav\> element, and there are text, link, image elements inside.

Main section includes a brand logo, brand icons and a form inside.
form got a \<fieldset\> in it. There are labels, input elements, a button and texts
which includes links in them.

At the last element which footer section, there are 2 div elements which first one
includes links and second one includes text elements.

We tried to make the page look like original one, so our page's styling is very similar.
