### Full Task description of project:

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design

### Description:

We added 3 main sections which are: nav, main, footer.

The \<nav\> element contains \<div\>, \<ul\> and \<li\> elements for menus in bars. Two bars, the white and yellow ones have position: fixed.

Main tag includes six \<section\> tags.
Inside  every section we added the content of the page using \<div\>, \<ul\>, background pictures, gradient layers etc.

The \<footer\> element contains two \<div\> tags for link list and copyrights.

In last project we learn and used grid layout but in this project we prefered flex-box mostly. Flex-box layout is more useful for responsive desgin pages. We also tried to used many different properties of this layout.
